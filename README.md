# euchre-scorer
A project to create a class that will score cards based on euchre rules.

I used this projects to learn a bit more about xUnit. 

I have always enjoyed playing Euchre. Euchre has a unique point system. In my Programming II college class, 
we were tasked with creating a card game. Most people went with Blackjack, but I chose Euchre. Now, I didn't 
realize what a difficult task that would be with Euchre's unique point system. I ended up creating a function
that mapped out every situation a euchre card's point value would be line by line. It was over 800 lines long. 
It was absurd, but hey, it worked! :)

Now, over the years, I've always thought I could simplify my 800 line function. I have achieved it and now the
class I made for it only has 57 lines total. Using a couple unit tests, my logic seems to be working as expected.

I hope to make a 3D version of Euchre in unity one day, and I will be using this class in there.
